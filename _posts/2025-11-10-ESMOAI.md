At the first [ESMO AI & Digital Oncology Congress](https://www.esmo.org/meeting-calendar/esmo-ai-and-digital-oncology-congress-2025) in Berlin I am presenting two posters discussing our experiences building and using various computational platforms for multimodal analysis (including histopathology images!) in oncology.

You can see the programme, abstracts and electronic copies of the posters on [ESMO's site](https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/coasis_21451/attendee/confcal_1/presentation), or continue reading to see information on both below.
