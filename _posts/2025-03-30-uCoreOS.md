## Intro

I have been using cloud native OS for my personal devices (and work ones during my PhD) for several years now; 
[first with Fedora Silverblue](https://fercrcode.github.io/posts/SilverblueSetup/) 
and lately using the excellent Bluefin and Bazzite images from [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/).

However, due in big part to the dauting prospect of having to set up most of my services and NAS, I have not made the same move for my home server. That is, until now. This post will therefore serve a guide for myself to document this journey and, hopefully, make the eventual next move more palatable. Let's go!

## uCore OS

[uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore?tab=readme-ov-file#ucore) is an opinionated and extended OCI image of Fedora CoreOS.
As I need my server to also act as a small capacity NAS, I will install the `ucore` image with the optional ZFS support.
My target will therefore be `ucore:stable-zfs`.

### Installation

Being based on CoreOS this is somewhat unique in that it usually requires a second machine to generate and "serve" an Ignition file, although here I will be generating the file locally on my server.

The instructions below have been taken from the uCore github and the [CoreOS documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/bare-metal/). This great guide was also used throughout the process: https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/beginners-guide-to-fedora-coreos/143037

1. https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore/blob/main/examples/ucore-autorebase.butane
2. Settings for butane
   - password: https://coreos.github.io/butane/examples/#using-password-authentication
   - ssh pub key
3. Generate Ignition file
   - https://coreos.github.io/butane/getting-started/
4. Trigger uCore installation
   - i.e. `sudo coreos-installer install /dev/nvme0n1 --ignition-url https://example.com/ucore-autorebase.ign` (or `--ignition-file /path/to/ucore-autorebase.ign`).
